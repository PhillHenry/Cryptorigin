# Cryptorigin
Explore cryptocurrenecy block chains using open source big data tools.

### About
Blockchains can grow too large for one machine to process. 
The aim of this project is to allow researchers to explore blockchains with the latest open source, big data technologies.

### Technologies
* Spark 2.0+
* Hadoop 2.7
* HBase as a key/value store. Since it is Hadoop based, this seems an appropriate choice of store.
